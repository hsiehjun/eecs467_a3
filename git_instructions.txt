SETUP
    Use github to fork our class repository at https://github.com/UMEECS467W15/eecs467

    Clone into your repository:
        git clone <url for your fork of the class repository> eecs467

    Setup the upstream connection:
        cd ~/eecs467
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/UMEECS467W15/eecs467.git


        Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork:
            git remote -v
